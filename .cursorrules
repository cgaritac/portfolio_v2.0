# Architecture and Technologies
- Project: Personal portfolio with React + strict TypeScript
- Architecture: Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)
- Build tool: Vite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4
- Package manager: npm (both local and CI/CD)
- Deployment: Firebase via GitHub Actions workflow

# FSD Structure
- Organize code following FSD: app/, pages/, widgets/, features/, entities/, shared/
- Each feature must be independent and self-contained
- Shared contains reusable code (ui, lib, api, config)
- Do not import from upper layers, only from lower or same layer

# TypeScript
- TypeScript strict mode always enabled
- Explicit typing in functions and props
- Use interfaces for component props
- Avoid 'any', use 'unknown' when necessary
- Define types in .types.ts or .interface.ts files

# React
- Functional components with hooks
- Destructured props in function signature
- Custom hooks for reusable logic (prefix 'use')
- Use React.memo only when necessary for performance
- Effect handling with useEffect and proper cleanup

# Tailwind CSS
- Use Tailwind v4 classes, no inline CSS or modules
- Mobile-first: design for mobile first, then breakpoints
- Extract components when classes repeat more than 3 times
- Use @apply only in exceptional cases
- Organize classes: layout → spacing → colors → typography → others

# Clean Code and SOLID
- Small functions with single responsibility (SRP)
- Descriptive and self-explanatory names
- Avoid obvious comments, code should be readable
- DRY: don't repeat code, extract to functions/hooks
- Components maximum 200 lines, if it grows more, split it
- Dependency injection when appropriate

# Code Conventions
- File names: camelCase for utilities, PascalCase for components
- Components: one component per file
- Exports: use export default for components, named exports for utilities
- Imports: organize in groups (external → internal → relative)
- Constants in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Variables and functions in camelCase

# Performance
- Lazy loading for routes and large components
- Optimize images (webp, lazy loading)
- Appropriate code splitting with dynamic imports
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

# Git and Deploy
- Descriptive commits in English: "feat: add Hero component"
- Ensure package-lock.json is always updated and committed
- Verify Vite build is successful before push
- Use npm for all package management operations
